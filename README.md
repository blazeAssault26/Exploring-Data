# Repo Overview

## IMDb Movies analysis

This project analyzes and visualizes movie statistics through a structured workflow. It begins with the importation of data on movie budgets, gross revenue, votes, and runtime. Next, the data is cleaned by handling missing values and correcting data types, focusing on issues such as missing "budget" values. With the cleaned data, summary statistics are calculated to understand central tendencies and spreads. Hypothesis testing is then performed, such as using Pearson correlation to confirm a positive relationship between "budget" and "gross revenue." Visualizations, including scatter plots and correlation matrices, illustrate the relationships between variables. The analysis concludes with a strong positive correlation (r = 0.74, p < 0.01) between a movie's budget and its gross revenue, suggesting that higher budgets tend to lead to higher revenue. These insights help filmmakers and studios make informed budget planning decisions.
